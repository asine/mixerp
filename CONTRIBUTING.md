#How to Sign CLA?

Create a new pull request, adding a new file to the project. The file should be added to "/contributors" directory. The file name should be same as your GitHub username ending with ".md" extension. For example, for the GitHub user `alex`, the file would be `alex.md`. The file must have the following contents:

```

I furthermore declare that I am authorized and able to make this
agreement and sign this declaration.

Signed,

```

Replace the text in square brackets as follows:

* Replace `[date]` with the AD date since when you want your agreement to be effective from. The format should be `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY/MM/DD`.

#Coding Style

* Use 4 spaces instead of a tab.
* Namespaces, type names, member names, and parameter names must use complete words or standard abbreviations.


**Pascal Case**

* Function and Methods.
* Resource Strings (Except ScrudResource).
* Enumerators. Name and Collection.
* Class, Namespace.
* Properties.
* ASP.net Server Control and HTML Control ids.
* Javascript class objects and event names.

**Camel Case**

* Variables, Objects, and Parameters.


**Naming ASP.net Server Controls and Html Controls**

Names should be spelled in American English. The control id attribute should suffix the control name and type to suggest the type of control.

**Correct**

```
<asp:TextBox ID="FirstNameTextBox" runat="server" />

<input type="text" id="FirstNameInputText" runat="server" />

<asp:Button ID="SaveButton" runat="server" />

<input type="button" id="SaveInputButton" />

<button type="button" id="SaveButton" />

```

**Incorrect**

```
<asp:TextBox ID="txt_FirstName" runat="server" />

<input type="text" id="FirstNameTB" runat="server" />

<asp:Button ID="SaveBtn" runat="server" />

<input type="button" id="Save_Button" />

<button type="button" id="BtnSave" />

```

##Other Important Rules to Follow
* Functions and methods names must always begin with verbs.
* Class names should be singular nouns.
* Collection, array, list, IEnumerable and similar objects should be plural.
* Controls implementing IDisposable should always remove event handlers. Please do not set 
  event delegate to null on Dispose() method.
