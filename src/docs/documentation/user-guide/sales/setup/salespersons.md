**Salesperson** is an individual who sells goods and services to other entities, individually or together with a [team](sales-team.md). The success of a salesperson is usually measured by the amount of sales he or she is able to make during a given period and how good that person is in influencing individuals to make a purchase order. If a salesperson is employed by a company, in some cases compensation can be determined based on the amount of goods or services sold.

**Salespersons** form is used to view, add, edit and delete salespersons of your organization.
