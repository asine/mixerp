#Current Date

Current date refers to the day after *End of Day* date. Regardless of your iPad's date or the application server's date, 
the current date is the date after the EOD operation was run. It also implies to the current date of all your transactions.


##Remember
MixERP does not use the server clock and therefore the current date remains open until you perform [EOD Operation](eod-operation.md).
After successful EOD operation, the current date is changed to the next day.
