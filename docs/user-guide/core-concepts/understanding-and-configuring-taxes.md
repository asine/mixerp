* Types of Government agencies depending upon where you operate: Local, Municipal, County, District, State, and Central Government.
* Where your transaction originates from and ships to. (Nexus Compliance)
* Nature of business.
* Exemptions depending upon whom you have business with.
* Exceptions, such as tax holidays.
* Requirement of frequent tax report filing and remit.
