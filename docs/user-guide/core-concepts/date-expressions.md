#Date Expressions

In order to save your precious time while doing your work, MixERP provides you with a unique ability to quickly enter Dates into the application by entering simple alphabetical expressions. This means that for the most part you might not have to type/select the whole date.

For example if you want to enter today's date simply type _"d"_ and hit TAB , MixERP will automatically enter today's date. 
If you want to enter yesterday's date just type in _"-d"_.
Similarly, enter _+d_ for tomorrow's date or _"2d"_ if you want to enter the date of day after tomorrow.

List of all the expressions applicable.
